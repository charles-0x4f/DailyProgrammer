This is my first attempt at a hard problem, I've only heard of genetic algorithms so I don't know much about them (I looked at two ~3 minute youtube videos and pretty much attempted to copy that).
It's kinda amateur and probably not very GA-y, but I managed to get a 454 score letting it run while I watched a movie, so I'm pretty proud of that.
